      <description>To the non-paleoclimatologist (basically everyone) the magnetic properties of dirt are likely not a source of inspiration. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a considerable amount of energy over the past four years thinking about the magnetism of dirt and what it means for the history of Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate. Wait, what?
To make sense of this, it is important to recognize a few things about geology and it&amp;rsquo;s subfield of paleoclimate.
 Paleo = &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;past&amp;rdquo; $\rightarrow$ paleoclimate = &amp;ldquo;past climates&amp;rdquo; For most past climates, we do not have any instrumental records (think thermometers) Geologist who study past climates (&amp;ldquo;paleoclimatologists&amp;rdquo;) need to make indirect observations of something that is correlated to changes in climate Usually this type of relationship is called a proxy and is based on something we can study in modern environments  Paleoclimate proxies form the basis for how geologists study past climates and shape the way we understand Earth&amp;rsquo;s history.</description>
