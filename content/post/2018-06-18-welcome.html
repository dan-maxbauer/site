<p>Hello! I created this blog as a place for me to learn new things and write about them. For my day job, I’m a visiting professor in geology at Carleton College. I teach about climate, paleobiology, and introductory geology. Its great and I love it. For my academic work, I regularly use R and have since I was a master’s student (~5 years now). I have wanted to be fancy and start a blog using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a> for a while, so, here it is. Now I’m fancy!</p>
<p>The theme of each post is likely to vary quite a bit here - and most content will likely be for me to learn about topics/tools I’m interested in more so than building a site that conveys expertise on a single topic.</p>
<p>Many posts will focus on my work in R - building different types of models/visualizations and exploring new data. But I’m also working towards learning Python, and I will incorportate some posts here and there that show some baby-steps towards that goal.</p>
<p>So, enjoy the ramblings! If there is anything you see in my posts that excites you (or horrifies you) feel free to reach out and get in touch.</p>
