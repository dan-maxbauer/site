abstract = "Non-detrital magnetic minerals occur in soils as a result of a complex set of processes that are controlled by soil forming factors during pedogenesis. Interpretations of paleoclimate and paleoenvironment based on magnetic mineral assemblages in paleosols is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing magnetic mineral populations that are controlled by climate and soil moisture from populations that are more sensitive to other processes. Here, we present evidence that grain-size specific magnetic properties, such as the frequency dependence of susceptibility and the ratio of anhysteretic to isothermal remanent magnetization, are insensitive to changing vegetation in soils developing under uniform climate, topography, and on similar parent material along the forest-prairie ecotone in NW Minnesota. Quantitative unmixing of coercivity spectra and first-order reversal curve diagrams across the transect support an easily identifiable fraction of fine-grained pedogenic magnetite that is highly consistent regardless of vegetation. In contrast, detrital magnetite is more abundant in prairie soils compared with forest soils indicating a partitioning in the preservation of detrital magnetite in soils developing under variable vegetation. This work highlights the need for careful identification of magnetic mineral populations in soils and sediments prior to making climatic and environmental interpretations. "
